## About This Project <a name="about"></a>

This is a browser responsive interface for a random password generator. When you load the page, a welcome message and instructions appear in an alert. There is an interactive button on the page, and when clicked, prompts will appear on screen for you to choose your password character options:
- Character length (8-128)
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers 
- Special characters 

After at least one character type is selected, your new password will appear on screen.
